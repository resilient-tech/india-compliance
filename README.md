It builds on top of [ERPNext](https://github.com/frappe/erpnext) and the [Frappe Framework](https://github.com/frappe/frappe) - incredible FOSS projects built and maintained by the incredible folks at Frappe. Go check these out if you haven't already!

## In-app Purchases

Some of the automation features available in India Compliance require access to [GST APIs](https://discuss.erpnext.com/t/introducing-india-compliance/86335#a-note-on-gst-apis-3). Since there are some costs associated with these APIs, they can be accessed by signing up for an India Compliance Account after installing this app.
